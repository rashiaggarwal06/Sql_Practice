# 2_joins â€” SQL Join Examples

This folder demonstrates different types of SQL joins:

- `inner_join.sql`: Combines rows with matching keys (e.g., employee and department)
- `left_right_join.sql`: 
  - LEFT JOIN includes all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right.
  - RIGHT JOIN includes all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left.
- `self_join.sql`: A table joined with itself to show relationships (e.g., employee and manager)

These examples help visualize how data is linked across tables using JOINs.
